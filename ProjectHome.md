**I am no longer developing on the project. There are number of reasons for this. First off, I strongly prefer developing in other languages (ie Python). Second, there is another Java roguelike project called JADE which is much more popular (wish I'd known about it when I started this project...) However, If you want to take over Jade Rogue, feel free to message me and I'll happily hand over ownership of the project.**

# Jade Rogue #

Welcome to Jade Rogue! This library aims to make Java roguelike development a breeze. Java has many great features for roguelike development. In addition to being very fast, it is object oriented, garbage collected, and platform independent. However, Java also has no console support. Jade aims to mitigate this while providing a power and feature rich framework for roguelike development. The framework includes console emulation, map generation, path finding, line of sight, field of view and much more.

To get started, check out the downloads section. If you want the latest version of the code, the source tab has more information. The [wiki](Home.md) includes some additional information on roguelikes, complete javadocs for the code, as well as a Jade tutorial. All of these wiki pages can be found in the links section of the homepage.

## Roguelikes ##

In case you are unsure about what a roguelike is, check out the following links:
  * [What is a roguelike?](http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=What_a_roguelike_is)
  * [Wikipedia Article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike)
  * [Jade Wiki on Roguelikes](Roguelike.md)
Essentially a roguelike is a hack-n-slash rpg with more focus on game play than graphics (in fact most roguelikes are done in pure ascii). Other common themes are permadeath, turn based, grid based, and random content. Given the deep and complex game play, they are more addicting and fun than you might think! I especially appreciated the random content as no two games are the same. If you haven't played a decent roguelike, you should try one out. The links section has includes a few of my personal favorites.

## About Me ##

I graduated with a B.S. in computer science from Brigham Young University. I am currently seeking a master's in computer science, also at BYU. My interests include artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing. I have played roguelikes, specifically Angband, for many years, although I am not particularly good. If you wish to contact me with suggestions, comments, bug reports, or anything roguelike related, drop me a note and I'll get back to you.
