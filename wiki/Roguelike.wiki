= What is a Roguelike =

=== Brief Background ===

Back in the early 1980's a revolutionary game called Rogue was created by a few
university students. It is consider to be the first graphical game ever (as
opposed to text games like Adventure). Don't get the wrong impression - these
graphics were composed of ascii characters on old unix terminals.

Decades later people would still be playing this game - or at least games based
on it. Even today there are thriving online communities and actived development
dedicated to this genre.

=== Defining Traits of a Roguelike ===

While the exact definition of a roguelike game is a little hard to pin down.
For every characteristic in the following list, there is a good roguelike that
breaks the rule. That said, roguelikes tend to have these features:
  * Random Content - one of the defining features of a roguelike is that the
    levels are all generated randomly. This means that no two games are alike, and
    new tactical problems can be encountered all the time.
  * Single Player - just like the original, in a roguelike a single player
    assumes the role of some brave adventurer - most often a daring '@' symbol.
  * Hack-n-slash - the major focus of most roguelikes is a dungeon filled with
    lots of monsters to kill. Finding the right balance between hack-n-slash and
    grinding is a challenge to modern roguelike developers.
  * Grid Based - the original rogue was played on a terminal, so the maps were
    all grid based.
  * Turn Based - roguelike game play does not happen in real time, allowing the
    player time to agonize over tough tactical decisions
  * Permadeath - just like the original rogue, most roguelike games have no redo
    or back loads if you die. Death is permanent. It is generally considered
    cheating (or save-scumming) to do so.
  * Minimal Story - most of the time the story is along the lines of "you need
    to fetch the <artifact of awesomeness> at the bottom of a dungeon." Other than
    that, its basically about killing lots of monsters in a random dungeon.
  * Ascii Graphics - proving that gameplay can compansate for poor graphics,
    many, if not most, roguelikes are played with ascii graphics, although many
    games, especially the newest ones, have the option to replace the ascii with
    graphical tile sets. It is my opinion that the ascii is awesome - you won't see
    me playing any roguelikes with tile sets.
  * Fantasy Setting - while there are a few scifi entries in the roguelike
    genre, the vast majority are set in some sort of fantasy setting full of elves,
    orcs, and dragons. Tolkien lore is another common theme.
  * DnD Combat - Most roguelikes have some sort of combat system that looks like
    combat from a (very much simplified) dungeons and dragons. Dice rolls determine
    hits, misses, damage, and whether your spell succeeded.
  * Small Open Source Projects - while there are a few exceptions, most
    roguelikes are small open source projects with a single developer.

=== So Why Play? ===

Roguelikes are incredibly fun. They may not have the bells and wistles of a modern
studio game with all its graphical eye candy, but the gameplay is deep, non-repetative 
and immersive. Don't take my word for it though, go and try out a few and see what you
think. Before you know, you too may become addicted to the roguelike genre!
